# Greek-Slavonic Parallel Corpus

This is the code for the web application developed to present the Greek-Slavonic Parallel Corpus (GSPC) project results.

The application is currently very much in development â€“ we thank you for your patience as we wrangle code and sort out bugs.

## Team

The GSPC project is being developed and maintained by Lev Shadrin and Anastasia Drozhzhina as part of their two-year Digital Humanities Master's degree at the Higher School of Economics. For a list of curators and advisors see the [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements) section.

## Project outline

The GSPC project seeks to develop a liturgical text alignment pipeline using augmented BERT transformer models. The project faces a number of issues, e.g. divergent textual structure, liturgical commentary, and limited exposure of transformer models to ancient languages.

Currently, the working languages comprise Greek and Church Slavonic, and Pentecostarion has been chosen as a test text. The team is enthisiastic about expanding the list of supported languages.

## Run

The app can be run using Docker Compose.

```
docker compose up
```
